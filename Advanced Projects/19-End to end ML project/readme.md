### Deploy a machine learning model using Python, HTML, and CSS


Here I will deploy a machine learning model using Python, HTML, and CSS. I will first train a machine learning model for the task of SMS Spam detection. The task of SMS spam detection model is to classify spam and not spam messages.

At the end, you will be able to copy and paste your messages in the user interface and the application will show you whether itâ€™s spam or not.

### How to do this

To Deploy a model using Python, HTML and CSS we need 4 files, namely:

1. App.py: The driver code, which will consist of the code to train a machine learning model and creating a flask API.
2. home.html: which will be a landing page where we will deploy our model.
3. style.css: which will be used to design our landing page
4. result.html: which will show us the result whether the message is spam or not.
